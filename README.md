# Rollup

This is a fork of [https://github.com/rollup/rollup](Rollup), published on NPM under [@mapbox/rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mapbox/rollup).

The intent behind this fork is to allow [Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) to target a branch of Rollup that includes changes that are expected to be accepted upstream but haven't yet been merged.
